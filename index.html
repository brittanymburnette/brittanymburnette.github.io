		  <p>Halle Place is part of is a supportive housing program that supports women who were formerly incarcerated which is part of the larger nonprofit, the Lord’s Place. With the help and assist of Val Stanley, Director of Women’s Services at Halle Place I had the privilege to visit with the group of women and exchange writing with a partner based on prompts we developed as a group. Within our group meetings and letter exchange we transgressed the boundaries we place between ourselves as individuals and those individuals we too quickly label and dismiss as less than or different.
