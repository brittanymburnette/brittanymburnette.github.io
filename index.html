<h1> Brittany Burnette</h1>

<p>My name is Brittany Burnette and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Miami. This is my first web page! I am scheduled to graduate in May 2020 with a major in Journalism and a minor in English. After graduation I hope to pursue a career in journalism or content creation for a digital media company. Taking web design is a great opportunity to learn techniques that will help me in my future in the professional field.</p>
