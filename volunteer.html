		   <a href="Halleplace.html"><h3>Halle Place</h3>Halle Place is part of a supportive housing program that supports women who were formerly incarcerated which is part of the larger nonprofit, the Lord’s Place. With the help and assistance of Val Stanley, Director of Women’s Services at Halle Place, I had the privilege to visit with a group of the female residents. We held meetings every week and exchanged letters with an assigned partner. The letters were centered around a topic that the entire group developed and agreed on. Within our group meetings and letter exchange we transgressed the boundaries we place between ourselves as individuals and those individuals we too quickly label and dismiss as less than or different.</a>

		   <a href="Exchange for Change.html"><h3>Exchange for Change</h3>In 2019 I participated in a letter exchange with Everglades Correctional Facility under a non-profit program called Exchange for Change. With the help of Joshua Schriftman, Kathie Klarreich and Chloë Firetto-Toomey I was assigned a inmate at ECI and we became pen pals. My pen pal at ECI went by the pseudonym “Altruism” and I went by the pseudonym "Lamb" and throughout our letter exchange I gained insight about Altruism’s background and life experiences which were different from my own. Furthermore, I was able to develop a complex understanding of current affairs, the need for new solutions in the carceral system, gain a sense of empowerment and realize my potential to create social change, and develop an ethic of service as my motivation shifted from charity, to compassion, and finally to empathy.</a>
